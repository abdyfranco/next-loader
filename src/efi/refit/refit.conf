# disables automatic booting (i.e., no timeout).
#
timeout 0

# Disable menu options for increased security. These are intended for a lab
# environment where the administrator doesn't want users to mess with the
# operating system. List the names for the options you want to hide from
# the boot menu. Currently supported:
#  shell       - remove the EFI shell
#  tools       - remove all EFI tools (shell and gptsync)
#  optical     - no booting from optical drives
#  external    - no booting from external disks or USB flash drives
#  internal    - no booting from internal disks; this setting is not
#                 recommended because it locks you out of all operating
#                 systems installed on the internal hard disks.
#  singleuser  - remove the submenu options to boot Mac OS X in single-user
#                 or verbose modes
#  hwtest      - remove the submenu option to run Apple Hardware Test
#  all         - all of the above, except for 'internal'
#
#disable external optical shell singleuser
disable tools hwtest

# Note: The 'disableopticalboot' and 'disableexternalboot' options from
# Charles Ahn's patch are also supported for compatibility. They are
# equivalent to 'disable optical' and 'disable external', respectively.

# Use a custom title banner instead of the rEFIt icon and name. The file
# path is relative to the directory where refit.efi is located. The color
# in the top left corner of the image is used as the background color
# for the menu screens. Currently uncompressed BMP images with color
# depths of 24, 8, 4 or 1 bits are supported.
#
banner hostname.bmp

# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144)
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for
# the big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given,
# the built-in default will be used for the small icons.
#
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of
# an uncompressed BMP image file.

# Hide the volume badge icons in the graphical main menu. There are three
# settings:
#  none      - show all volume badges (default)
#  internal  - hide badges on internal disk volumes only, allowing you to
#              distinguish CDs and occasionally connected external disks
#  all       - never show volume badges (not recommended)
#
hidebadges internal

# Hide various user interface elements. Here you can list the names of
# interface elements to hide. Currently supported:
#  banner    - the rEFIt title banner
#  shell     - the EFI shell icon
#  tools     - all EFI tools (shell and gptsync)
#  funcs     - built-in functions (about, restart)
#    ('tools' and 'funcs' together hide the complete second row of icons.)
#  label     - text label in the menu
#  hdbadges  - volume badges for internal disk volumes (same as
#               'hidebadges internal')
#  badges    - all volume badges (same as 'hidebadges all'); this setting
#               is not recommended because it won't let you distinguish
#               installed OSes and bootable CDs/DVDs.
#  all       - all of the above, except for 'badges'
#
# Note: The 'shell' and 'tools' options are equivalent to the 'disable'
# options with the same names.

# Disable display of text-mode output when in graphics mode. This
# option is unnecessary on Macs, but without this option, UEFI-based
# PCs tend to display text-mode messages relating to boot loader probing
# over the GUI display.

# Use text mode only. When enabled, this option forces rEFIt into text mode.

# List legacy options first. When enabled, legacy BIOS based boot options
# (e.g. Windows, Linux via LILO or GRUB) will be listed first. This is
# intended as a quick fix to change the default boot choice until full
# configurability arrives.
#
#legacyfirst

# Hide all legacy BIOS based boot options from the user. This option is
# useful if you boot all your OSes in EFI mode, as on a UEFI-based PC.
# Without it, rEFIt sometimes presents legacy boot options that don't
# work.

# Set the default menu selection.  The available arguments match the
# keyboard accelerators available within rEFIt.  You may select the default
# loader using a one-character abbreviation for the OS name ("M" = Mac OS X,
# "L" = Linux, "W" = Windows).  You may also specify a digit between 1 and
# 9, in which case the Nth loader in the menu will be the default.  You can
# also select a rEFIt tool entry ("S" = EFI Shell, "P" = Partitioning Tool,
# "U" = shutdown).  This is intended as a quick fix to change the default
# boot choice until full configurability arrives.
